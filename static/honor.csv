10,honor,Javed Iqbal,5,Excellent,Nice Smartphone In a Short budget....This mobile has a lightweight with good camera quality with face unlocking. Nice working with good brightness on the screen. It is quite handy and easy to use for old people as well. Low light facial recognition tool and raise to wake both are good gesture of this phone. and can expand memory upto 512 gb.

12,honor,Rachit  Shukla,4,Nice product,I don't like product so much but product is good in that price range but I suggest go with Realme C11 is better than this.
13,honor,Flipkart Customer,5,Classy product,"Very good phone at this range of price, fast performance, good display and camera quality at this range of price.In some cases who are not able to install youtube and other apps which won't be run without Google play services, just run those apps from Quick App Center in Huawei app gallery =>manager=>Quick App manager and search the app and open and keep a shortcut to home screen no need to install."
14,honor,Ratul Ghosh,3,Fair,Camera and performance i s good considering the price point. The only con that phone has that it does not support some main apps that needs google play services but its manageable.Its an good option to gift your parents.
15,honor,NANJIBHAI PATEL,5,Must buy!,"Honor 9S is perfect budget smart phone. After long time honor come back with good smart phone features with VIP hotline customer support.

16,honor,Smit Doshi,5,Worth every penny,I like it's camera and battery is good as per budget and 10w charger charging phone in 90 min  and the magic ui is also good and has good features
17,honor,Sandeep singh  choudhary,4,Pretty good,"You can run YouTube via a browserYou can download almost all of the apps via Appgallery, Petal Search but Google apps like Gmail,YouTube,google meet  are not directly accessable through this mobile but you can enjoy the google crome browser app through this mobile. From my point of view 32gb ROM and 2gb Ram are not available in this price range so I think this is a good budget phone."
18,honor,SK NASIM ALI,1,Waste of money!,Overall performance is very good apart from the Google Support. It should provide the Google Support. Only some apps are available in huwaei app galary. Some apps are available but not working properly as it is showing that it needs Google Support.
19,honor,Sidyesh Kadam,5,Terrific purchase,"Very handy phone, Good for daily usage, best thing is it comes with latest android 10 with magic UI over it.2 gb ram and 32 gb storage is enough for normal tasks.For this kind of a price the specs are Good, must go for those who have a crunched budget."

26,honor,Ajay Singh,5,Excellent,Nice product at this price. Sound quality is good. Rear Camera is good and can take natural colour photos  and front camera is also nice for selfie in daylight condition. Battery backup is very good. Display is also good and clear in outdoor contions. Good smooth performance but not for big graphical games. At this price range it is the beast. You never get a smartphone like this at this price range. I hope my review is helpful.
